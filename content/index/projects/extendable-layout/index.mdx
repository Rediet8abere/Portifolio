Mancala is one of the oldest board games that is played between two players in a turn-based manner.
In my program, a user plays the game against the computer, where the computer uses AI to generate best
moves using the Minimax Algorithm.The Minimax Algorithm helps find the best move by maximizing gain for
AI but minimizing gain for the player and backtracking to the original state when the game is over or
reached a certain depth.
